# Diamond-Price-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on features like cut, color, clarity, and carat. I applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms to achieve optimized performance. I used Google Colab, Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for this project.
